# Google Apps

Appscale is an open-source cloud computing platform that robotically deploys and scales unmodified google app engine programs over public and private cloud systems and on-premise clusters. Free Google Apps is modeled at the app engine apis and has support for python, move, personal home page and java applications.

Google apps domains are evolved and maintained with the aid of appscale systems, inc., based totally in santa barbara, california, and google.

### Prerequisities

The intention of appscale is to provide developers with a fast, api-pushed development platform which could run applications and change the primary domain in Google Apps on any cloud infrastructure. Appscale decouples utility logic from its service ecosystem to present builders and cloud directors manage over utility deployment, information garage, resource use, backup, and migration.

## Versioning

We use [Free Google Apps](https://www.gappsdomains.com/2016/01/25/how-to-sign-up-for-google-apps-free/) for domains. For the free google apps, see the tutorial on how to [change the primary domain](https://www.gappsdomains.com/2016/03/17/change-the-primary-domain-in-google-apps/).
